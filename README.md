# Video filters in Nexys 4 DDR
This project is a Systemverilog version of a video processor implemented in a Nexys 4 DDR, includes 4 filters dithering, colour scramble, grayscale and the original view.

## Requirements
This project was made to test a Nexys 4 DDR so you will need Vivado from Xilinx. The Repository contains a python code to send through serial port a video up to 200 frames (limited by the script) and to run that python script you will need the next packages:
- ![Opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- ![Pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)
- ![Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#description)

## Features

A ![DDR RAM Controller](https://github.com/alonsorb/ddr-ram-controller-mig) is taken as a basis for the task of saving a piece of video in the DDR2 SRAM of the Nexys 4 DDR and show it in a screen through VGA port. The image is shown at a resolution of 1024x768 pixels using a 78.8[MHz] clock.  

The UART was configurated with an input clock of 100[MHz] and a baud rate of 4M of baud rate (If there is a change for this parameter in the code its equivalent in the python script also have to be change)

The ![DDR RAM Controller](https://github.com/alonsorb/ddr-ram-controller-mig) allow to save 128 bits per address, because the pixels stored are 24 bits lenght, this means only 5 can be saved completely in every address, only 120 bits are used.

Because of the number of BRAM available the FPGA store a frame with a resolution of 512x384. To reach a resolution of 1024x768 every pixel is shown 4 times.


## Usage of python script
After installing the [Requirements](#requirements) packages you should call the next function in python IDLE 
```shell
>> FrameCapture(path_file, COM, size, frames_to_show)
```
If you want to use terminal or command prompt
```shell
$ python -i serial_video_loader.py
>> FrameCapture(path_file, COM, size, frames_to_show)
```

|Input Name|Description|Examples|
|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
|path_file|Path where the video is saved|"/home/jotad/Desktop/corto.mkv"<br>"corto.mkv" (if the video file is in the same folder of the script)|
|COM|Serial port where the fpga is connected|"COM4"<br>"/dev/ttyUSB1"|
|size|Resolution to resize the original video. The default value is 512x384. We recommend to not change this value.|(512,384)<br>(1024,768)|
|frames_to_show|The quantity of frames to send through the serial port to save in the DDR. After testing (not exhaustively so you can update it) we limited this value to 200 frames, if you put any value higher than 200 it will send 200 frames|10<br>150|

We provide the next example running the scrpt with python IDLE in Ubuntu:
```shell
>> FrameCapture('corto_original.mkv', '/dev/ttyUSB1', frames_to_show = 200)
```
And running in terminal
```shell
$ cd Desktop
$ python -i serial_video_loader.py
>> FrameCapture('corto_original.mkv', '/dev/ttyUSB1', frames_to_show = 200)
```

## FAQ

- **How to implement this project?**
    - You just need to create a new project and add all the design, ip and constraints sources. Then select the fpga model of Nexys 4 DDR (xc7a100tcsg324-1 in our case) and write the bitstream. Then program the fpga and run the python script to send the video to the fpga, remember to connect the VGA port.
- **Why I can't edit the ip cores?**
    - We created the ip cores in Vivado 2018.3 and it can change between Vivado versions so if you can't re-customize just create it from 'IP Catalog' and configure with your own specifications.
